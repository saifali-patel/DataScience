# COVID19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
In this project, datasets were preprocessed and merged to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University was used , which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
These two datasets were merged to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
